# Hi, I'm Jade Kelly.
## Welcome to my GitHub!
## Iâ€™m a final year student at IADT studying BSc (Hons) in Creative Computing with a particular interest in JavaScript and Full Stack development. 
## When I started this course I didnâ€™t have much experience with programming or languages. I developed an interest in databases which later fueled my passion for Fullstack development when I started to learn JavaScript.
